## Paper code and data

This is the code for the WWW 2024 underreview paper: [Short-Term Interests And Next Behavior Reconstruction with Diffusion Model Retrieval](Paper 87). We have implemented our methods in **Tensorflow**.

These are two datasets we used in our paperï¼Œ Kuairand and ml-1m respectively. After download them, you can correct the path into your own in `dataset_proess.py` and `ml_1m_process.py` respectively.

## Usage
The path of configuration file is `config`, you can modify the model path in `model.conf` and modify the relevant parmaters in `nn_param.conf`

As our model is in two different modes at training and testing phase, so you need to run `cmain_multi_graph.py` to train our model. As for the other comparison models, you can run the file`cmain.py` to train the model. Both the model use the same configuration file.

For example: `python3 cmain_multi_graph.py` and `python3 cmain.py`
